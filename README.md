Solutions to the AIS Can You Hack It challenges.

## Solutions
### Client-side Protections
#### Disabled (10 points)
The submit button is disabled, so you can either inspect it in the browser and remove the `disabled` property, or run the following command in the console:

```JavaScript
document.querySelector("button[disabled][ref='submitButton']").disabled = false;
```

After the button is enabled, just click it.

#### Button Clicker (15 points)
The "Click me a lot" button needs to be clicked 1000000 times before the Submit button will be accepted.
However looking at the Network tab in the developer tools we can see the source code for `button_clicker.js`, which shows us the number of clicks is tracked with the variable `ButtonClicker_num_clicks`.
There's also an extra security check if we simply set the value to greater than 1000000 without clicking the button: a local storage boolean `"ButtonClicker_hacking_detected"` which is set to `true` every 100ms with a timer `ButtonClicker_timerId`.

We can bypass both with the following command in the console:
```JavaScript
ButtonClicker_num_clicks = 1000000;
clearInterval(ButtonClicker_timerId);
localStorage.setItem("ButtonClicker_hacking_detected", false);
```

Then just click submit.
